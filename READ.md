Currently, smartphones are equipped with powerful processors and graphical processing units (GPU). Furthermore, a smartphone contains mobile communication antennas such as WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G and/or LTE, various sensors such as accelerometer, compass and yroscope, also a large screen and audio playback speakers. All the components consume certain amounts of the phone battery, though it is not known which ones are the most power-hungry. In this research we measured and evaluated the power consumption of different components of the smartphone and later developed an example application which shows how much power can be drawn from the battery at a time by enabling and using as manyhardware components as possible.

Application includes the following modules:
Wifi
Bluetooth
GPU
CPU
Wifi AP
Video play
Vibrant
flashlight torch
camera
